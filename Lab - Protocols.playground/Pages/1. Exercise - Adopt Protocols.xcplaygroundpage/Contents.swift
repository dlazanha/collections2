 ## Exercise - Adopt Protocols: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable, Comparable, and Codable

 Create a `Human` class with two properties: `name` of type `String` and `age` of type `Int`. You'll need to create a memberwise initializer for the class. Initialize two `Human` instances.

/*:
 Make the `Human` class adopt the `Equatable` protocol. Two instances of `Human` should be considered equal if their names and ages are identical to one another. Print the result of a boolean expression evaluating whether your two previously initialized `Human` objects are equal to each other (using `==`). Then print the result of a boolean expression evaluating whether your two previously initialized `Human` objects are not equal to each other (using `!=`).

/*:
 Make the `Human` class adopt the `Comparable` protocol. Sorting should be based on age. Create another three instances of a `Human`, then create an array called `people` of type `[Human]` with all of the `Human` objects that you have initialized. Create a new array called `sortedPeople` of type `[Human]` that is the `people` array sorted by age.

 Make the `Human` class adopt the `Codable` protocol. Create a `JSONEncoder` and use it to encode as data one of the `Human` objects you have initialized. Then use that `Data` object to initialize a `String` representing the data that is stored and print it to the console.
